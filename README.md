Module 3 Python Challenge

Completed by: Ashleigh Wittenberg

First challenge using python and provided CSV files to calculate requested results.

In this challenge I used Python script to analyze the records in the provided CSV files (budget_data.csv & election_data.csv) to calculate the following values:

budget_data.csv

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
